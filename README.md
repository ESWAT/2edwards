# Who.What.Where.Map Hack

Who.What.Where.Map – formerly known as Team 2 Edwards – entry for [Datafest Ottawa](https://twitter.com/datafestOTT). This is a visualization webapp, showing the breakdown of ethnic origin of Ottawa neighborhoods. We use [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) to map data gathered from [The Ottawa Neighbourhood Study](http://neighbourhoodstudy.ca/).

Can be seen [here](http://eswat.ca/2edwards). Given that we had ~12 hours to hack – including cleaning up the data for our purposes – this is very much a proof-in-concept.
